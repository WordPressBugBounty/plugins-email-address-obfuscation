Email Address Obfuscation prevents email harvesting by hiding email address appearing in your pages, while remaining visible to your site visitors.

== Description ==

A lightweight plugin that protects email addresses from email-harvesting bots, by converting email addresses characters to HTML entities. Hide email from Spam Bots using a shortcode `[obfuscate_email]` and built-in WordPress function [antispambot()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/antispambot/ "antispambot").

= Features =

* Obfuscate plain email address
* Obfuscate href mailto link in HTML anchor element
* Support for custom CSS class
* Support for email subject

= Usage =

**Obfuscate plain email address**

    [obfuscate_email email="your@email.com"]

**Create clickable email address**

    [obfuscate_email email="your@email.com" link=true]

**Add CSS class to the HTML anchor element**

    [obfuscate_email email="your@email.com" link=true class="my-class another-class"]

**Obfuscate email address with email subject**

    [obfuscate_email email='your@email.com?subject=My custom email subject']

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does it work? =

The plugin converts email addresses characters from `email` parameter of `[obfuscate_email]` shortcode to HTML entities. Email addresses on your web page will be obfuscated (hidden) from bots, while keeping them visible to humans. In fact, there are no visible changes to your website for visitors.

= How can check if the plugin works? =

View source code of your page (press `Ctrl + U` in web browser) and look for the place, where an email address is placed. You should see decimal entities instead of email address.

** Please note ** Inspector in developer tools automatically decode decimal and hexadecimal entities. You need to use *View source code*.
